Configuration Management (Short Note)

Configuration management is the process of automating, monitoring, designing, and managing system configurations across servers, networks, storage, and applications. It helps organizations maintain consistency, efficiency, and scalability without increasing IT staff. It is closely related to change management, which focuses on modifying configurations to meet new requirements.

Configuration management in DevOps mainly covers three areas:
Identification – Finding and documenting configuration needs
Control – Managing changes in a controlled manner
Audit – Ensuring compliance and system validation

Key components include:

Artifact Repository
Source Code Repository
Configuration Management Data Architecture

Puppet (Short Explanation)

Puppet is a DevOps configuration management tool developed by Puppet Labs. It automates the deployment, configuration, and management of servers using code (Infrastructure as Code). It is written in Ruby DSL and supports multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS. Puppet follows a client-server model with a Puppet Master and agent nodes.

Puppet Building Blocks
Resources – Basic units that perform tasks
Classes – Group of related resources
Manifest – Files (.pp) containing Puppet code
Modules – Reusable collection of manifests and classes

Here is the **short version**:

* If Windows nodes fetch configurations from a **Puppet Master**, a **Linux/Unix server** is required to run the master.
* If Windows nodes use **`puppet apply` locally**, the **Puppet Agent service should be disabled** after installation.
